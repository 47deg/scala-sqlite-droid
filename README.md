Mvessel
=============

**Mvessel** is a JDBC driver written in Scala. The main goal is to allow the use of ORMs in Android.

The project is organized in three modules:

* [mockAndroid](mock-android)
  Contains classes from the Android Open Source project without the `final` modifier in order to be mocked. Used only for test purposes.

* [core](core)
  Contains all core classes but relies on some [api classes](core/src/main/scala/com/fortysevendeg/mvessel/api) to do all the work. The main benefit of this module is that is not dependent of the Android API.

* [androidDriver](android-driver)
  Implements the [api classes](core/src/main/scala/com/fortysevendeg/mvessel/api) using [SQLiteDatabase](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html) and derived classes.

Also contains the [android-it](android-it) subdirectory with [instrumentation tests](http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_android.html#Instrumentation) and a subdirectory [samples](samples) with some example projects about how to use.

# How to use in Android

## Import in your project

*SBT*
```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.fortysevendeg" %% "mvessel-android" % "0.1"
```

*Gradle*
```
compile 'com.fortysevendeg:mvessel-android_2.11:0.1'
```

*Maven*
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.fortysevendeg</groupId>
	<artifactId>mvessel-android_2.11</artifactId>
	<version>0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

**Using the last available version**

You can use the SNAPSHOT version by adding the sonatype SNAPSHOT repository to your resolver list:

* https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/

And use the latest version: `0.2-SNAPSHOT`

## Create a SQLiteOpenHelper

Android comes with a helper class to manage the creation and version management of our database. This class is [SQLiteOpenHelper](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper.html). We can use this helper class to let Android platform create the database file for us and later access to that file through our JDBC driver or favorite ORM.

Our `SQLiteOpenHelper` could be something like:

*Scala*
```scala
class ContactsOpenHelper(context: Context)
  extends SQLiteOpenHelper(context, "database.db", javaNull, 1) {

  def onCreate(db: SQLiteDatabase) {
    // Use this method to initialize your database
  }

  def onUpgrade(db: SQLiteDatabase, oldVersion: Int, newVersion: Int) = {
		// Use this method to upgrade your database
  }
}
```

*Java*
```java
public class ContactsOpenHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {

    public ContactsOpenHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, "database.db", null, 1);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
       // Use this method to initialize your database
    }

    @Override
    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
       // Use this method to upgrade your database
    }

}
```

## Use java.sql classes

If you want to work directly with the `java.sql` classes you could create a method in our `SQLiteOpenHelper` that returns the `java.sql.Connection`.

*Scala*
```scala
def openConnection() = {
	// 1. This statement will create the database and trigger the `onCreate` and `onUpgrade` methods.
	val database: SQLiteDatabase = getReadableDatabase()
	// 2. Register the driver, making available for `java.sql`
	com.fortysevendeg.mvessel.AndroidDriver.register()
	// 3. Open a connection using the path provided by the database
	DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:" + database.getPath)
}
```

*Java*
```java
public Connection openConnection() {
	// 1. This statement will create the database and trigger the `onCreate` and `onUpgrade` methods.
	SQLiteDatabase database = getReadableDatabase();
	// 2. Register the driver, making available for `java.sql`
	com.fortysevendeg.mvessel.AndroidDriver.register();
	// 3. Open a connection using the path provided by the database
	return DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:" + database.getPath);
}
```

**Note:** You should add a method to `close` the connection.

##Â Use the `Database` class

You can directly create a connection with the `Database` class provided in the library. Again in your `SQLiteOpenHelper`:

*Scala*
```scala
def openDatabase() = {
	// 1. This statement will create the database and trigger the `onCreate` and `onUpgrade` methods.
	val database: SQLiteDatabase = getReadableDatabase()
	// 2. Open the database using the path provided by the database
	new Database[AndroidCursor](
	      databaseFactory = new AndroidDatabaseFactory,
	      name = database.getPath,
	      timeout = 50,
	      retry = 0,
	      flags = 0)
}
```

*Java*
```java
public Database openDatabase() {
	// 1. This statement will create the database and trigger the `onCreate` and `onUpgrade` methods.
	SQLiteDatabase database = getReadableDatabase();
	// 2. Open the database using the path provided by the database
	return new Database<AndroidCursor>(new AndroidDatabaseFactory(), database.getPath(), 50, 0, 0);
}
```

See the [sample in Java](samples/simple-android) and the [sample in Scala](samples/scala-android) for a more detailed instructions.

## Use with Slick

See the [sample with Slick](samples/slick) for a sample of usage.

# Build

This project is built with [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). To build the artifacts you could use:

`sbt package`

# Collaborate

Actually there are multiples ways to collaborate.

The first place to look is the [GitHub issue tracking](https://github.com/47deg/mvessel/issues). Also, if you found a not listed bug, please submit it with a detailed description.

The [samples](samples) always need to be improved (upgrade versions, make it more attractive). Also, feel free to add new samples.

At last, there are a lot of functionalities [not implemented yet](https://github.com/47deg/mvessel/search?q=notimplemented&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93). The tests are prepared to fail when a new functionality is added so don't forget to add the tests cases along with the new implementation.
